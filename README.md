# Project-318
Contaminated River Treatment Project by SIIPL, Pune, India
__________
Project Name : Contaminated River Treatment Project by SIIPL, Pune, India
_____
the project activity is pre-approved under the UCR RoU program for the following scope:
### Scope 4: Measures that remove bacteriological and other impurities from contaminated water bodies or unutilized water, so that water is made suitable for re-use and/or recycling purposes.

____________________
Between 2016 and 2022, the project activity has treated 3411 million litres of contaminated
river water successfully with gainful end use of the same. This contaminated river (MulaMutha) is outside the project activity boundary and showcases the PP's commitment towards
water stewardship and efficiency. The PP highlights the catalytic role that corporate India must
play in reducing industrial water consumption as well as water pollution per unit of industrial
output. The PP has showcased technologies that creates safe drinking water from a known
contaminated river resource and has overcome the challenges faced by the alternate
methods implemented and being proposed for the same by regulators. The project activity
is an example of local stakeholders, especially corporates to reconnect with the rivers to build
positive sustainable water conservation action. For any vaccine production, water is the most
widely used substance, raw material or starting material in the production, processing and
formulation of pharmaceutical products. As the neighboring area to the project activity are
residential, the PP did not want to reduce the drinking water level by diverting huge quantities
water daily either through bore well or approvals from PMC. Further, the digging of numerous
bore wells in the absence of the project activity would have also created acute ground water
shortage for the local residents of Hadapsar, Pune. The project activity prioritizes and showcases
best in class contaminated river water treatment and treated sludge management technologies,
along with the reuse of treated river water for captive industrial use as a key corporate
environmental intervention towards a more water secure India
